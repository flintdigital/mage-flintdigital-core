# mage-flintdigital-core

This plugin can hold any misc functionality that don't really fit into a plugin. For now is a placeholder for the main Flint Digital tab at the admin panel.

This means that this plugin is required for any other FD plugin that has admin options.

###Modgit Install

` modgit add mage-flintdigital-core git@github.com:flintdigital/mage-flintdigital-core.git `
